# How To Register a Free.tk Domains From Freenom [Solved]

So I wanted a free host-name with DNS to access my server easily & settled with a ddns.net domain from no-ip.
Problem was when I went on to setup Cloudflare, it wouldn’t register as it was a sub-domain. 
Eventually I got to know about Freenom, that offered free domains that too with managed DNS.
For Freenom you can only sign-up once you have a domain so I went on an searched for one :

As soon as I would find a domain & click the Get it now! button a progress bar would show up 
followed by Not available message. It was frustrating because at one instance it showed available 
& then suddenly no-more. It was quite confusing.

I tried switching networks & used different VPN’s but still the issue persisted.

## Solution :
So it’s a pretty ridiculous bug. All you have to do is add .tk or whichever TLD you prefer in the search bar. 
This also changes the Get it now! button to Select.
